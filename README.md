# rust-small-projects

A collection of small, focused projects and experiments written in Rust.

Each subdirectory in this repository is a compact Rust project that demonstrates a single concept, algorithm, or small utility. These projects are intended for learning, quick reference, and experimentation.

## Contents

- Examples and mini-projects using Rust and common crates
- Small utilities, algorithms, and learning exercises

- Project index: [projects/projects.md](projects/projects.md)

See each folder's own README or source files for project-specific instructions.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Install Rust and Cargo (https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

# rust-small-projects

A collection of small, focused projects and experiments written in Rust.

Each directory in this repository contains a compact Rust project that demonstrates a single concept, algorithm, or small utility. These projects are intended for learning, quick reference, and experimentation.

## Contents

- Examples and mini-projects using Rust and common crates
- Small utilities, algorithms, and learning exercises

Check each project's directory for source code and any project-specific README or instructions.

## Getting started

Prerequisites: Install Rust and Cargo â€” see https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install.

To run a project:

1. Change into the project's directory (for example `cd examples/hello_world`).
2. Build and run with Cargo:

   cargo run

To run tests for a project:

   cargo test

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Open an issue or submit a pull request with small, focused changes. Prefer one project per PR and include clear instructions for running or testing.

If you'd like me to, I can also:

- Generate an index (SUMMARY.md) listing each folder and a short description
- Create missing `README.md` files inside projects that don't have one

Let me know which of those you'd like and I'll update the repo accordingly.
